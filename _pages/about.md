About Me
======
I am a postdoctoral researcher at IUSTI (CNRS-Aix-Marseille Université), working on the ANR SWIFTS project where I develop AI algorithms for multi-source data fusion applied to flood modeling and wastewater networks. I recently completed my PhD in Computer Science through an international joint program between Université d'Artois (France) and Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah University (Morocco), focusing on uncertainty reasoning and possibilistic conditioning.

My research bridges theoretical contributions in belief revision with practical applications in geospatial data integration, combining machine learning, graph theory, and GIS technologies. Through international collaborations in Vietnam and South Africa as part of the STARWARS project, I've developed expertise in handling heterogeneous spatial data and network topology analysis.

Research Interests
======
- **Uncertainty Reasoning**: Possibilistic logic, belief revision, Fagin-Halpern conditioning
- **Spatial Data Science**: Multi-source data fusion, GIS modeling, network topology
- **Machine Learning**: Deep learning for geospatial applications, graph neural networks
- **Infrastructure Networks**: Wastewater network modeling, flood simulation, hydraulic systems

Current Position
======
**Postdoctoral Researcher** (November 2025 - Present)  
IUSTI, UMR 7343 CNRS – Aix-Marseille Université, Marseille, France  
*ANR SWIFTS Project: Merging Multi-Source Data for Shallow Water Model Parameterization*

- Multi-source data integration (GIS raster/vector, shapefiles) for hydraulic models
- Remote sensing: SAR and optical imagery for flood mapping and land cover analysis
- Development of image processing pipelines for feature extraction
- Collaboration with IRD (UMR EspaceDev, Montpellier) and CNES (Toulouse)
